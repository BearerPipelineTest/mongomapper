### Suggestions

If you want to help with the documentation, but don't know how to help, [here are some ideas](https://github.com/mongomapper/mongomapper/issues?labels=documentation) of things that need documented.

### Guidelines

In order to maintain quality, here are some guidelines for contributing to the MongoMapper documentation.

-   Don't document hacks or workarounds. If MongoMapper is broken or doesn't support something, note it in the docs and add an issue to the [issue tracker](http://github.com/mongomapper/mongomapper/issues).
-   Avoid narratives. People don't really care why you're writing the documentation, they just want to know how to use MongoMapper.
-   Be concise without sacrificing clarity.
